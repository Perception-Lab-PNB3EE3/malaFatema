# Final Analysis Code 
This file is the final analysis code for th experiment testing the effects of environment priming on participants' reaction times and accuracy for various rotation tasks. 
Research Question: How does environment priming (urban vs. rural) impact reaction times and accuracy in mental rotation tasks?
Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that priming participants with an urban environment will influence their ability to perform the mental rotation tasks more effectively (either faster or more accurately).
