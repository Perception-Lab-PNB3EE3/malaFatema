The priming paradigm included prime and probe tasks within 1 trial. In the prime task, 16 participants were asked to mentally rotate an inverted object to upright. In the probe task, they were asked to judge whether 2 objects simultaneously presented were the same or different. In result, the priming effect was observed in the upright position in both strategies, but not in the inverted and intermediate position while using a flipping strategy. The result in the present study was consistent with that of Kanamori and Vagi (2002). In conclusion, when the 2 strategies for transformation of inverted images to upright images are used, apparent differences are observed in each direction of rotation. The results suggested that mental rotation occurred during the spinning strategy, but another transformation of images rather than mental rotation occurred during the flipping strategy. The line-symmetrical transformation around the horizontal axis might be used in the flipping strategy.},

Negative primes also enhanced the performance of non-athletes in relation to their peers who had positive primes, but there were no differences in MR performances under positive priming.

We discovered that the perceived relative distances of familiar objects in natural settings depended in unexpected ways on the surrounding visual field. Observers bisected egocentric distances in a lobby, in a hallway, and on an open lawn. Three key findings were the following: (1) Perceived midpoints were too far from the observer, which is the opposite of the common foreshortening effect. (2) Thisantiforeshorteningconstant error depended on the environmental setting — greatest in the lobby and hall but nonsignificant on the lawn. (3) Context also affected distance discrimination; variability was greater in the hall than in the lobby or on the lawn. A second experiment replicated these findings, using a method of constant stimuli. Evidently, both the accuracy and the precision of perceived distance depend on subtle properties of the surrounding environment.},

Studies on cognitive function in BD shows i.a. deficits in visuospatial processing and visuospatial memory. However, studies have not used Mental Rotation Task to evaluate these functions so far. Our aim is to introduce this method to assess abovementioned deficits in euthymic BD patients.
31 euthymic BD patients and 27 healthy volunteers matched for age and years of education were recruited. All participants performed digital version of Mental Rotation Task. In this task, participants were asked to compare two figures rotated against each other and declare its similarity or difference indicating whether the figures are identical or whether they constitute their own mirror image.
The test revealed significantly longer reaction times in the group of BD patients when images were rotated by - 90, - 45, 45, 90 degrees, or not rotated at all. There was no significant difference in condition of - 135, 135 or 180 degrees. The accuracy rate was significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group for the entire test and in each condition. The correlation between the average response time and the accuracy rate turned out to be insignificant.
Our results are consistent with studies presenting visuospatial deficits in bipolar disorder. In this study we show for the first time that mental rotation deficits are present in euthymic state of BD patients.},

Women athletes and non-athletes (N = 67) completed several MR tasks after doing a word scramble that included positive or negative sports terms. The MR performance of athletes was diminished in relation to that of non-athletes when primed with negative sports-related actions. Negative primes also enhanced the performance of non-athletes in relation to their peers who had positive primes, but there were no differences in MR performances under positive priming. Thus, those who identified with a group experienced threat that negatively impacted performance, but non-athletes were unlikely to have been affected by evaluative performance concerns.},

The priming paradigm included prime and probe tasks within 1 trial. In the prime task, 16 participants were asked to mentally rotate an inverted object to upright. In the probe task, they were asked to judge whether 2 objects simultaneously presented were the same or different. In result, the priming effect was observed in the upright position in both strategies, but not in the inverted and intermediate position while using a flipping strategy. The result in the present study was consistent with that of Kanamori and Vagi (2002). In conclusion, when the 2 strategies for transformation of inverted images to upright images are used, apparent differences are observed in each direction of rotation. The results suggested that mental rotation occurred during the spinning strategy, but another transformation of images rather than mental rotation occurred during the flipping strategy. The line-symmetrical transformation around the horizontal axis might be used in the flipping strategy.},

Previous studies proposed that this human-body advantage in mental rotation is mediated by one's projections of body axes onto a human-like object, implying that human-like objects elicit a strategy shift, from an object-based to an egocentric mental rotation. To test this idea, we investigated whether mental rotation performance involving a human-like object had a stronger association with spatial perspective-taking, which entails egocentric mental rotation, than a nonsense object. In the present study, female participants completed a chronometric mental rotation task with nonsense and human-like objects. Their spatial perspective-taking ability was then assessed using the Road Map Test and the Spatial Orientation Test. Mental rotation response times (RTs) were shorter for human-like than for nonsense objects, replicating previous research. More importantly, spatial perspective-taking had a stronger negative correlation with RTs for human-like than for nonsense objects. These findings suggest that human-like stimuli in the same/different mental rotation task induce a strategy shift toward efficient egocentric mental rotation.},

Two central questions about mental rotation remain: Does mental rotation depend on analog spatial representations, and does mental rotation depend on motor simulation? A review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies help answer these questions. Mental rotation is accompanied by increased activity in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent regions. These areas contain spatially mapped representations, and activity in these areas is modulated by parametric manipulations of mental rotation tasks, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations. Mental rotation also is accompanied by activity in the medial superior precentral cortex, particularly under conditions that favor motor simulation, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on motor simulation in some situations. The relationship between mental rotation and motor simulation can be understood in terms of how these two processes update spatial reference frames.},

	abstract = {Urban advantages in older adults’ cognitive function have been observed. Less is known about early-life urban dwelling and late-life cognition. We evaluate how rural/urban dwelling throughout life and rural to urban shifts in life relate with cognition in Mexico, a country experiencing aging and urbanization. Data came from the 2003 and 2012 Mexican Health and Aging Study (n = 12,238 adults age 50+). Early-life urban dwelling was self-reported. Late-life urban dwelling was based on population size of respondents’ community of residence (community 2500+ people) at the time of survey. Cognitive function was measured across several cognitive tasks. We assess differences in baseline cognitive function and nine-year decline across groups using a latent change score model. Cross-sectionally, compared to always rural dwellers, rural-urban transitions were associated with cognitive benefits, though individuals residing in urban areas continuously through life exhibited the highest levels of cognitive function (β = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.83, 0.96) even after adjusting for SES, health, and health behaviors (β = 0.28, 95\% CI: 0.22, 0.35). Longitudinally, always urban dwellers exhibited slower decline than always rural dwellers when adjusting for baseline cognition (β = 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.18), though faster decline when baseline cognition was not adjusted (β = −0.11, 95\% CI: -0.18, −0.04). No differences were observed for cognitive change across comparison groups after adjusting for potential mechanisms. Early- and late-life urban dwelling may result in cognitive advantages for older Mexican adults. Clinicians should consider where individuals resided throughout life to better understand a patient's likelihood of experiencing poor cognitive outcomes. •Urban dwelling in early- or late-life was associated with better late-life cognitive ability in Mexico.•Always-urban dwellers had the highest level of cognitive ability.•Compared to always-rural dwellers, rural-to-urban transition in life was associated with better cognitive ability in old age.•Always-urban differed from always-rural dwellers in their pace of cognitive decline depending on baseline controls.},

We examined, in a large cohort of older adults (n = 3447), whether susceptibility to a multisensory illusion, the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI), was influenced by the reported urbanity of current and childhood (at age 14 years) residence. If urban environments help to shape healthy perceptual function, we predicted reduced SIFI susceptibility in urban dwellers. Participants reporting urban, compared with rural, childhood residence were less susceptible to SIFI at longer Stimulus-Onset Asynchronies (SOAs). Those currently residing in urban environments were more susceptible to SIFI at longer SOAs, particularly if they scored low on general cognitive function. These findings held even when controlling for a several covariates, such as age, sex, education, social participation and cognitive ability. Exposure to urban environments in childhood may influence individual differences in perception and offer a multisensory perceptual benefit in older age.},

The current study examined how 2D:4D and MR differences among women of European descent ( N=41) were related to their (a) preferences for male faces: attractive (ATM), short-term (STM), and long-term mate (LTM), and (b) psychological femininity and masculinity, as measured by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) (Bem, 1981). To examine potential changes in facial preferences over their menstrual cycle, participants' preferences were measured during two experimental sessions separated by 2 weeks. The results indicated that (a) femininity scores decreased with decreasing 2D:4D, (b) masculinity scores increased with faster MR, (c) women preferred a more masculine male face for an STM than for an LTM, and (d) preference changes over the menstrual cycle varied systematically with 2D:4D. When compared with women with high 2D:4D ratios, low 2D:4D women (e) preferred a more masculine LTM, (f) recalled less parental bonding, (g) had shorter intimate relationships, and (h) reported more menstrual irregularity.
