# My Experiment
This is an experiment built using the [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) library that can be used to create experiments. In this experiment, participants will be presented with two visual stimuli: a blue square and an orange circle. The goal is to measure their reaction times and accuracy when responding to these stimuli. Participants will press 'j' for the blue stimulus and 'f' for the orange stimulus. There will be multiple trials after which the average reaction time and accuracy will be calculated. 

## Files Included
- **myNewExperiment.html**: This is the main experiment with the image adjustments. 
- **ReactionTime**: This is the tutorial experiment which was used to complete the assignment.  
- **MyExperiment**: This is the Hello World Tutorial file. 
- **jspsych/**: This is the downloaded jsPsych library files which were used to create the experiment.  
- **img/**: Folder that contains the images used in the experiment (`newblue.png`, `neworange.png`)

## Prerequisites before starting the experiment
You would need to have a web browser in order to run this experiment. 
- Access to the images (`newblue.png`, `neworange.png`) in the `img/` folder. These are the modified images (the blue square and the smaller orange circle)
- The image files (blue.png and orange.png) are for the ReactionTime experiment. The myNewExperiment file will use (newblue.png and neworange.png)

## How to Run the Experiment
1. Open the `myNewExperiment.html` file in a web browser.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the experiment.

## Notes
- Make sure that the images (`newblue.png` and `neworange.png`) are in the correct directory (`img/`) for the experiment to run properly.
